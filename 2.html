<h2>AI-muchine learning engineer</h2>
Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.
 It is regarded as a field of artificial intelligence.
  It is a field that develops algorithms and technologies that enable computers to learn.
   For example, it can be trained to identify whether an email received through machine learning is spam or not.
The core of machine learning lies in representation and generalization.
 Representation is the evaluation of data, and generalization is the processing of data that is not yet known.
  It is also a field of computational learning theory.
   There are various applications of machine learning. Character recognition is the best known example of using it.
