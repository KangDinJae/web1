<h2>Cloud engineer</h2>
    The cloud is called a cloud that enables data to be used anytime, anywhere by simply connecting the server and the server to the Internet.
    Officials believe that in the future, this cloud will be able to establish a complete global network by connecting servers all over the world.
    It is predicted to change the shape of the current data center by 2021.
    In addition, it is expected that the role of the cloud engineer will increase in this process.
    From the standpoint of national organizations and companies operating the cloud, it is urgent to recruit experts to upgrade the existing cloud.
